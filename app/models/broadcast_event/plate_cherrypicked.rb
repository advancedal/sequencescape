# Declares the event of a destination plate created from
# a list of source plates. It requires the following subjects:
#   - Robot - the robot that acted in the cherrypicking process (Beckman)
#   - Samples - all samples that were cherrypicked to build this plate
#   - Source Plates - all source plates that were the source of the cherrypicking
#   - Destination plate **NOT REQUIRED**- the plate that has been cherrypicked into
# If any of these subjects is missing the instance will be considered invalid
# The destination plate subject, if not specified, will be generated from the seed
# as the seed is considered the destination plate.
